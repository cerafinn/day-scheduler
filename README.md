## Usage

The web application allows a user to enter information for the hours between 9AM and 6PM. The user can save the information for each hour using the save button, and it will save in Local Storage. The application uses jQuery within the JavaScript functions and BootStrap to format the look of the website. Template literals are used to dynamically create the body of the website, displaying the hours, textarea and save button.
